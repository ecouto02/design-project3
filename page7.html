          <p>This website was created for young adults who love reading and even for young adults who may be starting to read.A lot of these books are highly recommended by others and some others are books that I recommended because I've enjoyed reading them. Here you can find multiple different books that have been sectioned into five different genres. There is Mystery, Sci-fi, Thriller/Horror, Fantasy and Romance.</p> 

          <p>Ive chosen to create a website on book recommendations because I'm a reader myself so I read a lot and when I dont know what to read next I'm usually searching to find more books that I may like. I believe that lot's of other people may fall into the same situation as me. So why not create a website to help with the situation. There's definitely some books that I would like to read now. Hopefully there are some books that may interest you when looking through the lists.  If there are some books you may like, click on the book and it will lead you to where you could purchase it.</p>
